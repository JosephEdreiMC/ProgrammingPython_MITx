# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. MITx6.00.1x.
This repository contains the code produced during the course 'Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python' offered by MITx.

The content includes:

- Fundamentals such as loops, control flow
- Iterative and recursive functions such as the bisection method, applied in the coding of a credit card's lowest monthly payment calculator.
- Coding of a Hangman word game using a dictionary approach.
- Coding of a classic Scrabble game that can be played by the user or computer.
- Usage of classes (key of Object-Oriented Programming) to code a Caesar Cipher that, given an encrypted text, returns the best possible decrypted message by automatically trying all possible shifts until getting the one that produces the largest number of valid words.
